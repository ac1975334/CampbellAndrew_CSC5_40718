"The objective of the game is that you are trying to put the  numbers in order from their current mixed state, in as few moves as possible if you want a challenge.  There will be one blank spot on the board that will be used for moving numbers around, only a number directly above/below or to the left/right of the empty spot can be moved into it.  The blank spot will then become the moved number’s old spot, which can then accept another number to be moved into it and so on.  A number that is not left/right or above/below the empty spot cannot be moved and if the user chooses such a number an error will come back letting them know it is an invalid move.  "
